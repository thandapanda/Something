Hey.

It’s just an extended clipboard where you can copy multiple texts multiple times and paste the entire copied content at once in doc or any place you want.

The application runs in the background until terminated so no hindrance on screen or taskbar.

CONTROLS So each time you press ctrl+c, the text is stored and appended until you press ctr+v. 
Ctrl+v pastes the entire data. 
Ctrl+y terminates the application.

NOTE: Copying/pasting with a drop down menu would not work.

Would love to get a feedback.
